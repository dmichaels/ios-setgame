**Logicard** is a logical card matching game based on the Mensa award winning SET Game.

## Objective

Create as many **SET**s as possible.
A **SET** is 3 cards whose 4 attributes are either/or:
- All the **same**
- All **different**
Alternatively: If exactly 2 attributes are the same then it is *not* a SET.

## SET Attributes
The 4 SET card atttibutes and 3 values are:
- number: one, two, three
- color: RED, GREEN, BLUE
- filling: HOLLOW, SOLID, SHADED
- shape: BAR, DI-BAR, TRI-BAR

## Example
This is a SET because each card has different numbers (one, two, three); different colors (RED, GREEN, BLUE); different fillings (HOLLOW, SOLID, SHADED); and different shapes (BAR, DI-BAR, TRI-BAR).
EXAMPLE-1

## Another Example
This is a SET because each card has the same number (one); the same color (RED); the same filling (HOLLOW); but different shapes (BAR, DI-BAR, TRI-BAR).
EXAMPLE-2

## The Fundamental Theorem
For any 2 SET cards there is **exactly** 1 other card which will make it a SET.

## Status Bar & Settings
The status bar contains left-to-right:
- number of SETs found so far
- number of cards left in deck
- emoji SET hint
- number of SETs currently visible
- peek button to reveal SETs
STATUS-IMAGE-1
The emoji hint turns to 👌 if the first card tapped is part of a SET; and to 👍 if the second one is.
The last 3 items, supportive of learning (or cheating), can be turned off in the **Settings** page.
Also there is a timer option, as well as sundry other options.

## Extra Challange
For a more taxing cognitive task, choose the **Mono** Card Images on the **Settings** page.
Same idea as above except instead of color we have number columns (one, two, or three) as an attribute. For example:
