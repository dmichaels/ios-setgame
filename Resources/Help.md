**Logicard** is a logical card matching game based on the Mensa award winning SET Game.

## Objective

To create as many **SET**s as possible.
A **SET** is 3 cards whose 4 attributes are EITHER/OR:
- All the **same**
- All **different**

## SET Attributes
The four SET card atttibutes and three values are:
- Number: one, two, or three
- Color: red, green, blue
- Filling: hollow, solid, shaded
- Shape: bar, di-bar, or tri-bar

## Example
This is a SET because each card has different numbers (1, 2, 3); different colors (red, green, blue); different fillings (hollow, solid, shaded); and different shapes (bar, di-bar, tri-bar).
EXAMPLE-1

## Another Example
This is a SET because each card has the same number (1); the same color (red); the same filling (hollow); but different shapes (bar, di-bar, tri-bar).
EXAMPLE-2

## The Fundamental Theorem
For any 2 SET cards there is **exactly** 1 other card which will make it a SET.
