**Logicard** is a logical card matching game based on the Mensa award winning SET Game.

## Objective

Create as many **SET**s as possible.
A **SET** is 3 cards whose 4 attributes are EITHER/OR:
- All the **same**
- All **different**

## SET Attributes
The 4 SET card atttibutes and 3 values are:
- Number: one, two, three
- Color: red, green, blue
- Filling: hollow, solid, shaded
- Shape: bar, di-bar, tri-bar

## Example
This is a SET because each card has different numbers (1, 2, 3); different colors (red, green, blue); different fillings (hollow, solid, shaded); and different shapes (bar, di-bar, tri-bar).
EXAMPLE-1

## Another Example
This is a SET because each card has the same number (1); the same color (red); the same filling (hollow); but different shapes (bar, di-bar, tri-bar).
EXAMPLE-2

## The Fundamental Theorem
For any 2 SET cards there is **exactly** 1 other card which will make it a SET.

## Status Bar
The status bar contains left-to-right:
- Number of SETs found so far
- Number of card left in deck
- Emoji SET hint
- Number of SETs currently visible
- Peek button to reveal SETs
STATUS-BAR-IMAGE-1
The emoji hint turns to 👌 if the first card tapped is part of a SET; and to 👍 if the second one tapped is. The last 3 items can be turned off/on in the Settings. There is also a timer which may be enabled in Settings.
